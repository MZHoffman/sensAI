# sensAI
## Description
sensAI is an AI enhanced learning and management platform created as a group project during the July 2023 NorthCoders bootcamp.

### The Problem
There is a teacher retention and recruitment crisis due to high teacher workloads and this is negatively affecting student outcomes as teachers lack the time to provide quality feedback and tailored lesson plans.

### The Solution
We have created an app that utilises the power of AI to mark student work and generate assignments and lessons  on any subject, age group, and selected exam boards. sensAI can also be used to manage student lessons, assignments, and communicate between students as a teacher or to your teacher as a student.
